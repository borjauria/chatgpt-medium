<h1>SQL Chatbot using GPT-based Language Model</h1>

<h3>Overview:</h3>
The SQL Chatbot project is an innovative application that harnesses the power of the GPT-based language model to assist users with SQL-related queries. This specialized chatbot is tailored to understand, interpret, and respond to questions pertaining exclusively to SQL, serving both as a learning aid and a troubleshooting assistant.

<h3>Technical Details:</h3>
Core Technology: The underlying technology of this project is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, a cutting-edge deep learning model designed for various natural language processing tasks.

<h3>Functionality:</h3> The chatbot is programmed to recognize SQL-related questions, ensuring that the responses are accurate and relevant to the domain of SQL. It filters out unrelated queries to maintain a focused conversation.

<h3>Prerequisites:</h3> OpenAI API key

<h3>Integration with Python:</h3> The project is implemented in Python, leveraging its vast ecosystem of libraries and tools. The integration with GPT ensures smooth interaction and real-time responses.

<h3>Security:</h3> Given the specificity of the domain, the chatbot ensures that interactions remain within the realm of SQL. It does not process or store personal information, making it a safe tool for educational and professional purposes.

<h3>Deployment & Repository:</h3> The entire codebase is hosted on GitHub, allowing for easy version control, collaboration, and updates. Users can clone the repository, contribute to its development, or simply use it as a standalone tool.

</h4>Future Scope:</h4>
Plans for the future development of this SQL Chatbot include enhancing its understanding of complex SQL queries, integrating with databases for real-time query execution, and expanding its domain to include related technologies like NoSQL.
