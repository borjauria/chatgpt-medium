<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>The SQL Chatbot project is an innovative application that harnesses the power of the GPT-based language model to assist users with SQL-related queries. This specialized chatbot is tailored to understand, interpret, and respond to questions pertaining exclusively to SQL, serving both as a learning aid and a troubleshooting assistant.</p>

<h3>Technical Details:</h3>
Core Technology: <p>The underlying technology of this project is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, a cutting-edge deep learning model designed for various natural language processing tasks.</p>

<h3>Functionality:</h3> <p>The chatbot is programmed to recognize SQL-related questions, ensuring that the responses are accurate and relevant to the domain of SQL. It filters out unrelated queries to maintain a focused conversation.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites:</h3> <p>OpenAI API key

<h3>Integration with Python:</h3> <p>The project is implemented in Python, leveraging its vast ecosystem of libraries and tools. The integration with GPT ensures smooth interaction and real-time responses.</p>

<h3>Security:</h3> <p>Given the specificity of the domain, the chatbot ensures that interactions remain within the realm of SQL. It does not process or store personal information, making it a safe tool for educational and professional purposes.</p>

<h3>Deployment & Repository:</h3> <p></p>The entire codebase is hosted on GitHub, allowing for easy version control, collaboration, and updates. Users can clone the repository, contribute to its development, or simply use it as a standalone tool.</p>

<h4>Future Scope:</h4>
<p>Plans for the future development of this SQL Chatbot include enhancing its understanding of complex SQL queries, integrating with databases for real-time query execution, and expanding its domain to include related technologies like NoSQL.</p>
